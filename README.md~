Algorithms_Comp_Prep Repository

This repository contains the study guide I wrote to prepare for the 
Fall 2019 UL Lafatette PhD Comprehensive Exam in Algorithms.

The file of interest to most people is "Algorithms_Comp.pdf," 
in the directory "CSCE_500_Comps_Prep."

In the PDF, you will find python code illustrating the algorithms.  
Those .py files are in that directory.

Also of in the repository are these directories:
    CSCE_500_Comps_Scans
	Scanned copies of exams back to 2006
    CSCE_500_Fall_2017
	Dr. Tzeng's lecture slides	

The project is closed.  

If you want to download the files, start your own repository, 
and expand the contents to include later exams, more topics, 
more examples, more code... you have my blessing.  

I studied for the exam by:
    1.  Retyping the last seven exams.
    2.  Making an index of the topics.
    3.  Making study guides for each topic.
    4.  Writing out solutions to questions on each topic.
    5.  Sharing the file with classmates who pointed out mistakes.  

To edit in your own repostitory:
   0.  Learn LaTeX.
   1.  Find the Algorithms_Comp.tex file.  
       Everything else is linked from there.
   2.  Create new TeX files and link them in the head file.
   3.  Compile.

Good luck!
